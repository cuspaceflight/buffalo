Archive of flight logs, especially the accelerometer (ADXL345) and
barometer (MS5611) logs, for testing state estimation and mission control.

Folders ideally contain a python script or other documentation to describe
and extract the raw data log file, and the common format is a numpy compressed
archive with members:

accel_t         accelerometer reading times, in seconds since boot
accel_v         accelerometer readings, up axially, in m/s/s, with gravity
pressure_t      barometer reading times, in seconds since boot
pressure_v      barometer readings, in Pa
