Early M2FC tests at EARS. Flying on Just-In-Time. y-axis was down.
Possibly flying on Pro54 J430 or similar.

See m2fc_channels.txt for a channel map.


flights:
00007: flight is about 370 to 430 seconds
00011: flight is about 290 to 370 seconds


Packet format was:
u32 timestamp in 1/168e6 seconds
u16 unused checksum
u8 mode
u8 channel
8 bytes of data

Mode meant:
